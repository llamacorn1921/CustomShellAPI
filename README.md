# CustomShell API

## This is an api for the custom shell I am creating.

## It includes some tools, utils, and some of the existing build-in commands also

### NOTE: CustomShell uses [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) for console text, and extras, at the moment but might change in the future.
## ANOTHER NOTE: I know the code may suck. It needs to be cleaned up and it is not final at all or ready for use yet.
